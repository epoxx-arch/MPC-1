# MPC

(1) For MPC solutions, please refer to the following materials:
1. The MPC.pdf document given above
2. For OSQP solver:https://osqp.org/docs/examples/mpc.html#matlabï¼ŒThis python uses Sparse QP Formulation
3.https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/141871796  Condensed QP Formulation

(2) The Hierarchical-MPC project is developed based on ROS. This simulation can use the simulation environment under the f110_simulator project. The usage is as follows:

1. Compile the Hierarchical-MPC and f110_simulator in the workspace
2. Start the simulation environment: roslaunch f110_simulator simulator.launch
3.  Start the control algorithm: roslaunch hmpc_auto_race hmpc.launch
